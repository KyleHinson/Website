                    I can't believe I am still writing this in HTML
                    <br>
                    I am thinking of designing this web a little better
                    <br>
                    but eh, I will do it if I have time

                    My family is a special family in my opinion<br>
                    We don't really have much tradition or rule to follow
                    <br> But if I have to find one out
                    <br> I would say that the special tradition in my family is
                    <br> Not eating in the same place
                    <br> For some reasons, our family has decided that
                    <br> We won't eat in the same room, 
                    <br> no matter lunch or dinner
                    <br> You may ask,"But wouldnt that be lonely"
                    <br> "How about family time??"
                    <br> Well, I don't know either
                    <br> <mark><u class="general"></u>I am known to be not close to my family so</u></mark>
                    <br> I dont really know what else should I say lmao
                    <br> Well somehow this sounds depressing
                    <br> But I think this is not a bad thing since I can have my lone time

                        I have never been proud of myself

                        <br> I dont shine, I dont have any special things
                        <br> Wow somehow everytime I am writing my SDL
                        <br> I sound so depressing
                        <br> Well maybe it is because I am treating it like a diary
                        <br> dw about me, I have many happy things in love
                        <br> Writing the unhappy things down is just my habbits
                        <br> so it is why I sound depressing but I am not actually that sad irl
                        <br> I am fine as heck, probably

                        My Little Aiport, aka MLA 
                        <br> is a indie band in HK <mark>which</mark> is still active
                        <br> They dont sing very well to be honest
                        <br> But some of their lyrics are very relatable
                        <br> Everytime I listem to them, it is like listening ot a poem
                        <br> Unfortunately, not many people like their style of music
                        <br> Which is quite sad for me since I like them very much
                        <br> Here is a part of the song I translated from their song 
                        <br> The song is about the feeling when people are leaving Hong Kong
                        <br> To live in another country

                        <brMAX> When you decided to leave
                        <br> No one can understand my pain 
                        <br> I dont have the gut to stay at party anymore
                        <br> I dont have the gut to greet my friends
                        <brMAX>
                        <br> When you are gone without looking back
                        <br> Mountain and ocean arent the same no more
                        <br> There are no points to wake up early
                        <br> No pillow can make me fall asleep now
                        <brMAX>
                        <br> This world only have one sorrowness
                        <br> And it is the time without you
                        <br> Hong Kong is not my home anymore
                        <br> Just pretend I am travelling around the world
