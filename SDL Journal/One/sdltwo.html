                    I can't believe I am still writing this in HTML
                    <br>
                    I am thinking of designing this web a little better
                    <br>
                    but eh, I will do it if I have time

                    My family is a special family in my opinion<br>
                    We don't really have much tradition or rule to follow
                    <br> But if I have to find one out
                    <br> I would say that the special tradition in my family is
                    <br> Not eating in the same place
                    <br> For some reasons, our family has decided that
                    <br> We won't eat in the same room, 
                    <br> no matter lunch or dinner
                    <br> You may ask,"But wouldnt that be lonely"
                    <br> "How about family time??"
                    <br> Well, I don't know either

                    <br> I dont really know
                    <br>Other than these two I am also in love with music
                    <br>I played electric guitar/acoustic guitar mainly
                    <br>and sometimes piano(Self taught so not that great)

                        I don't know what am I doing these few months
                        <br>Sometimes I feel empty and unmotivated
                        <br>I am not physically tired but mentally tired for no reason
                        <br>I remember you saying that you won't have the patience to eat supplement
                        <br>And it reminds me of not taking medicine for a several months
                        <br>I think I am pushing myself too hard to the point that 
                        <br>I am getting nothing done
                        <br>I cant focus on church nor studying
                        <br>And I have had insomnia for the past few months
                        <br>I am really unsure about the future
                        <br>I don't know if I can get through the following year tbh

                        <br>Wow I didnt realise it is just emotion dumping until I am writing till here 
                        <br>But I will see if my mental can improve after being in school now

                        I would concentrate better if the lesson is interative
                        <br>And it will be more fun + easy to memorize
                        <br>And I hope maybe we can have some break between lesson
                        <br>Sometimes English lesson can turn boring due to..
                        <br>Well it is hard to make teaching important skill fun
                        <br>And we might fall asleep or hard to concentrate
                        <br>It would be great if we can have break and rest
                        <br>Maybe we can listen to a song in English
                        <br>Or just a simple break for 3-4 minutes
                        <br>Like just a break without ruining the teaching schedule

                        <br>Doing something that I am not interested in is very difficult

                        <br>Especially if it is a fiction book
                        <br>(For some reason non-fiction book interest me more)
