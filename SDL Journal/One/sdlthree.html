                    I hate people telling me that everything will be fine<br>
                    <mark><u class="general"></u>Despite knowing they say that because they are kind,</u></mark>
                    <br> I still feel uneasy and upset whenever I heard that.
                    <br> <mark>Feeling sad and being hopeless</mark>
                    <br> just telling me everything will get better wont help me in any way
                    <br> <mark>I understand my friends, who are very kind, are just trying to help me</mark>
                    <br> However, sometimes I just want to have someone who listen to me
                    <br> Or even just agree with my feeling
                    <br> Like I am pushing myself to make everything better
                    <br> It is **me** who make everything fine
                    <br> Saying everything will be fine is just like telling me that 
                    <br> Everything I have is just worthless and not helpful in anyway
                    <br> Here's an example
                    <br> Last time I was sad and I talk to my friends
                    <br> and I talked so much about my feeling and why I dont think my life is fine 
                    <br> Guess what I got for reply?
                    <br> "Oh it is ok, you will be fine just dont be sad"
                    <br> I was like dang I guess I am just gonna be NOT SAD
                    <br> Why havent I thought about that oh my goodness
                    <br> I was so mad that I wasnt sad anymore
                    <br> So just dont tell me everything will be fine 
                    <br> Because no, it won't
