                    <br>-&of course html <u class="general">which I am using right now</u>
                    <br>Other than these two I am also in love with music
                    <br>I played electric guitar/acoustic guitar mainly
                    <br>and sometimes piano(Self taught so not that great)

                        I don't know what am I doing these few months
                        <br>Sometimes I feel empty and unmotivated
                        <br>I am not physically tired but mentally tired for no reason
                        <br>I remember you saying that you won't have the patience to eat supplement
                        <br>And it reminds me of not taking medicine for a several months
                        <br>I think I am pushing myself too hard to the point that 
                        <br>I am getting nothing done
                        <br>I cant focus on church nor studying
                        <br>And I have had insomnia for the past few months
                        <br>I am really unsure about the future
                        <br>I don't know if I can get through the following year tbh
                        <br><u class="general">If I cant get better, I wont be able to keep my academic result</u>
                        <br>Wow I didnt realise it is just emotion dumping until I am writing till here 
                        <br>But I will see if my mental can improve after being in school now

                        I would concentrate better if the lesson is interative
                        <br>And it will be more fun + easy to memorize
                        <br>And I hope maybe we can have some break between lesson
                        <br>Sometimes English lesson can turn boring due to..
                        <br>Well it is hard to make teaching important skill fun
                        <br>And we might fall asleep or hard to concentrate
                        <br>It would be great if we can have break and rest
                        <br>Maybe we can listen to a song in English
                        <br>Or just a simple break for 3-4 minutes
                        <br>Like just a break without ruining the teaching schedule
                        <br><u class="general">Resting will make our mind refresh</u>

                        I hope I can learn more vocabs in this year
                        <br>And I hope I can gain the interest of reading books
                        <br>Doing something that I am not interested in is very difficult
                        <br>Most of the time I wont even bother opening a books
                        <br>Especially if it is a fiction book
                        <br>(For some reason non-fiction book interest me more)
                        <br>And I hope I can improve my writing skill
                        <br>because sometimes I dont know how to express myself
