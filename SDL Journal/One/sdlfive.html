                    <mark> if I had 24 hours to do whatever I want,</mark> 
                    I would use it to travel around the globe. 
                    There are many places that I wanted to go but never been able to
                     since I don't have time nor money. <mark>If I had no limitations on place and money,</mark>
                      I could be going to every place that I have dreamt to go in just a single day.
                     <mark>I wish I could go to Japan first</mark>, since this is the number one place that I want to be in. 
                      I would visit Osaka and Tokyo while having Japanese food such as Ramen and Sushi. 
                      Then, I will go to France. <mark>Being called the country of romance,</mark> 
                      I would like to go to Paris and learn more about the personality of the country.
                       After going to France, <mark>I would go to Germany, where a lot of famous people was born.</mark>
                        I have been learning German but I am not that confident that I can communicate with them properly.
                         Before ending the journey, I would just go to random countries, such as UK, USA, Canada, etc.
                            Last but not least, I would like to go home. I would like to share my experience with my family, 
                            and I would like to let myself know that there are still many things to live for in the world.
